#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

    1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
        -Software Engineering refers to the methodical use of engineering concepts, techniques, and instruments that enables the 
        creation and upkeep of superior software systems. It includes the design, development, testing, deployment, 
        and maintenance of software products.
    - It is important as it makes it possible to develop software systems and applications that power many facets of contemporary life, 
        such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare, software engineering is essential to the technology sector.


    2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

        -Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a 
        discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


    3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
    - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
    - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
    - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
    - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
    - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


    4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
        - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
        - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

    5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
    - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
    - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
    - System Architect: Designs the overall structure and architecture of software systems.
    - UI/UX Designer: Creates user interfaces and designs user experiences for software applications.

    6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
        -IDEs are crucial because they streamline the development process by giving developers a centralized place to write, test, and debug code.
        They include functions including code editing, support for several programming languages, code compilation, and debugging tools. 
        For instance, Visual Studio Code has an intuitive user interface, clever code autocompletion, and a smooth version control integration with Git.

        -version control systems (VCS) like as Git are essential for monitoring changes, maintaining code versions, and promoting teamwork. 
        Git facilitates the efficient storage, sharing, and management of code repositories by developers. In addition, it facilitates branch
        management, version control, and smooth code merging, guaranteeing teamwork and code integrity.

    7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
    - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
    - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
    Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
    
    8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
    - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
    - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
    - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

    -They are important as they contribute to the early detection and correction of flaws in software development, resulting in better software.
    Teams dedicated to software quality assurance may detect flaws in software early on, enhance its dependability, satisfy user requirements, 
    and provide high-caliber software that is dependable, stable, and easy to use.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    -Prompt engineering is the construction of queries or statements that elicit the greatest possible answers from artificial intelligence models.
    -It is important as it helps avoid getting confusing answers by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need."
